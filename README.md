# vuejs-tutorial-elagconf2022

## Tutorial Steps
1. go through what to install, node, yarn, vue cli
2. explain the various options when creating a new project, using extra stuff like nuxt, etc
3. go through the folders that get created when you initialise a vue project, but also note that vue can be incorporated into any project using a CDN for example
4. start going through the first default HelloWorld.vue component, and start to modify it to do what we want to do: something that ingests a csv, gets the coords, and show them on a leaflet map
5. also show how you can debug and see what's going on using the vue console tool and the normal console tool
6. FIRST COMPONENT show how to import a package that will process the csv
7. SECOND COMPONENT show to to make API calls to geonames
8. SHOW ON MAP -> I'm thinking it's starting to be a little too ambitious - maybe we can ask them to do this on their own and get in touch if they have issues?
